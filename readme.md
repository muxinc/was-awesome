## Design Software

- [Macromedia Fireworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Fireworks) - The first good design tool built for the web (that slicing tho!)

## JavaScript Frameworks

Note: A lot of these frameworks are still being developed today. They might still be awesome, but [they used to too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndBjraV-3UY), and at the time they were _the_ tools.

- [MooTools](https://mootools.net/) - A collection of JS utilities that was originally released as an extension of PrototypeJS. There may have been other ways of doing DOM effects/transitions < 2010, but...MooTools...
- [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/) - Extended native JS objects to take (some of) the pain out of browser development. Originally released in 2005 as part of the foundation for Ajax support in Ruby on Rails ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_JavaScript_Framework)).
